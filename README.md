## Image_Classifier_Project
### Project 2

**Description**
In this project, you will first develop code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow, then you will convert it into a command line application.

**Data**

The data for this project is so large, so I cannot upload it onto Github.

**File**

- Project_Image_Classifier_Project (4).ipynb:  first part of the project, image classifier built with TensorFlow
- predict.py:  second part of the project, is the file that uses a trained network to predict the class for an input image.
